# nanodialogue

dynamic dialogue box system for playdate, based off of [pdDialogue](https://github.com/PlaydateSquad/pdDialogue), and to be used in Overflow.

no documentation (as of now), and not as feature-rich as pdDialogue, *but* it has text effects like inverted text, shaky text, and floating text!

just thought i'd make this code public in case anyone wanted to see it :)
